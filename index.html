			<h1>Why Working Paper?</h1>
			<p>In an era where a single product decision can trigger regulatory scrutiny and public outcry across continents, you need experts who are equally adept at building innovative products as they are at assembling coalitions of stakeholders across industry, civil society, and regulatory bodies. In the modern information ecosystem, creating the right environment for product delivery can be as critically important as creating the right product.</p>
			<p>Our principals have:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Led and executed strategic planning</b> for major tech platforms, product companies, and philanthropies while navigating complex policy environments</li>
				<li><b>Built AI monetization strategies</b> for Fortune 500 companies while ensuring regulatory compliance</li>
				<li><b>Launched products</b> that turned privacy constraints into competitive advantages via a deep understanding of interactions between utility functions, privacy regulation, and PETs</li>
				<li><b>Created partnerships</b> across US policy makers, EU policy makers, industry, and academia to accelerate regulatory approval of cancer therapies</li>
				<li><b>Designed the innovative privacy infrastructure and governance</b> for one of the largest consented research studies in tech history</li>
				<li><b>Facilitated researcher collaboration worldwide</b> that built credibility with key stakeholders and accelerated approval processes for privacy-sensitive products and AI solutions</li>
			</ul>

			<h1>Our Unique Edge</h1>
			<p><b>Product-First, Policy-Fluent:</b> We approach every challenge through the lens of shipping great products. Whether you're implementing novel AI agents, embracing privacy-enhancing technologies to modernize your data lake, or navigating challenging multi-stakeholder environments, we bring the rigor of product management to policy problems and the sophistication of policy thinking to product challenges.</p>
			<p><b>Tested at Scale:</b> From Meta's election integrity initiatives to the very first implementations of next-generation privacy technologies, we've operated at the highest stakes under intense scrutiny. We know what works in theory — and more importantly, how to test which theories survive contact with reality.</p>
			<p><b>Bridge Builders by Design:</b> With deep relationships across technology companies, civil society, academia, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies, we don't just navigate ecosystems—we help build and shape them. Just as the intersection between product and policy is core to our business, partnerships and coalitions help us address your core business challenges.</p>
			<p><b>Focused on impact:</b> We don't just understand the technical specifications of emerging AI standards—we've helped build and shape them. We don't just interpret regulatory requirements—we've implemented governance frameworks at scale that are quoted in and shape legislation. </p>
