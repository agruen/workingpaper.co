## Media folks and non-technical academics don't know enough about GitHub.
### Let's fix that.
![](/images/blog/github.png)

"What, exactly, _is_ [GitHub](https://github.com/)?" is a (remarkably) good question.  It's so many different things: A code repository.  A social network.  A collaboration tool.  A free website host?  A way to collaborate on texts, yet maintain authority?

Yes and yes, it turns out.  I know just how valuable both these uses are for media folks and non-technical academics, yet most in either group don't know anything about it.

#### Free web hosting?

No more $150/year on Squarespace... can rely on the largess of Microsoft.



## Media
* There were a host of layoffs in the news world this past week at  [BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, and Gannett](https://www.thecut.com/2019/01/1-000-people-cut-in-huffpost-gannett-buzzfeed-layoffs.html).
* I think the core of it is that all three of these players still rely heavily on undifferentiated advertising to large audiences.  That market is likely gone forever, abdicated (or rightfully earned, depending on your view) to Google and Facebook.
* Unless you're a *huge* brand _and_ you have both advertising and other revenue, you're in a tough spot.  Broad-based players like BuzzFeed and the HuffPo lack the brand of CNN, The New York Times, or the Washington Post, and also lack significant alternative revenue streams.

## Hacks
* There's much more to come on the open-source, low-cost, home IoT topic, but, to get things started, here's a few links of note:
    - Hubs (central repositories to connect multiple types of equipment, and in some cases, automate them)
        * For those exclusively in the iOS ecosystem, the choice is called [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/).
        * If you use multiple device types, the path forward is the significantly more powerful (and, unfortunately, complex) [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io).
    - Inexpensive hardware (both to run a hub and also to "sense" things around the house)
        * [Raspberry Pi 3B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/) (with, perhaps, a [touch screen](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-touch-display/)) -- good for running a bunch of things at once, including if you plan to process video and/or using it as a big remote control.
        * [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) -- an incredibly inexpensive yet capable device: you can run Homebridge on one, and also set it up, with a camera, to be a security camera for well under $50.
        * [ESP8266-based Microcontrollers](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20190128151708&SearchText=Esp8266) These are a post unto themselves, but: they're Arduino-like tools.  They host a bunch of [GPIO](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi_gpio_intro.asp) pins attached to a WiFi chipset and an [open-source "OS"](http://www.nodemcu.com/index_cn.html) that runs very simple Lua code.  Attach sensors or other things to interact with the real world.

## Upgrades
* Slightly unexpected as a travel upgrade, but I'm in the process of switching my pharmacy to [PillPack](PillPack.com).
* Because meds come in per-dose packets, I can grab the right days, toss them into my dop kit, and go.  Nice.
* There's a consumerization of healthcare post in here... for another day.

### I'm Reading
* [Farewell from Arq](https://thisisarq.com/read/farewell-from-arq), the thoughtful goodbye note from a Jew-ish newsletter/publication that is a (surely unintentional) counterpoint to the other media layoffs last week.  Danya is in the same spot, and responding in a _very_ different way.

### I'm Listening To
* [Roman II -- Krzysztof Komeda Quartet](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/roman-ii-from-knife-in-the-water/514843606?i=514843926)
