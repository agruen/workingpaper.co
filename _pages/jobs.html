<p>Working Paper is deliberate about staying small. We don't hire to fill seats &mdash; we hire people who bring genuine expertise and care deeply about the work. We take on engagements we believe in and are committed to doing well, and we need people who share that commitment.</p>

<p>We believe how something gets built matters as much as what gets built. Our clients come to us when they need to ship ambitious work in complex, multi-stakeholder environments &mdash; spaces where a single product decision can implicate researchers, regulators, civil society, and the public. If that kind of challenge excites you, we'd like to hear from you.</p>

<p>We're always interested in meeting people who combine technical literacy with strong judgment, who can navigate ambiguity, and who want to work on things that matter with people who care about getting them right. We value rigor without bureaucracy, ambition without ego, and impact without compromise.</p>
