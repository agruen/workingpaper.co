There isn't supposed to be much news in the last week of August. Â This past week was different.

I intended to continue the discussion of information fiduciaries, but there were too many other interesting links on a different subject: media companies are continuing the trend of independence from tech platforms.

This week, Timehop builds their own ad server, Quartz starts a paid newsletter, Google's ad tracking expands, a local newspaper group tries to raise its own capital from the public, and Twitter announces a political ad policy that's (helpfully) different than Facebook's.

One tiny piece of analysis on the last one. Â Twitter is doing two interesting things: defining news organizations and recognizing that they have a different place in society than other commercial entities.

This is a Good Thing.

Happy Labor Day (to those of you in the U.S.), and, for those Minnesotans amongst us, regards from theÂ [Turkey To Go](http://turkeytogo.com/index.html)Â booth at theÂ [Great Minnesota Get Together](https://www.mnstatefair.org/)!

## Media
-   Twitter exempts news organizations from its new political advertising registrationÂ policy.
    -   Ren LaForme at Poynter has a goodÂ [overview](https://www.poynter.org/news/twitters-new-political-ad-policy-exempts-news-media-facebooks-still-doesnt).
    -   In doing this, Twitter has definedÂ [what qualifies as a news organization](https://media.twitter.com/en_us/articles/generic/issue-ads-policy--what-this-means-for-news-organizations.html).
    -   This is in direct opposition to Facebook's policy.
    -   My biggest question: what will Twitter do about single-subject news organizations covering a controversial topic in depth? (Think, for example, of aÂ [News Deeply](https://www.newsdeeply.com/)Â property.)
    -   Anyone going through the process? Â [Let me know](mailto:ag@workingpaper.co).

-   Digiday's Kerry Flynn profile'sÂ Timehop's decision toÂ [run their own ad serving platform](https://digiday.com/marketing/memory-app-timehop-built-ad-server-go-near-death-profitable/).
    -   This is another facet for a bonafide trend: control
    -   Digital publishers are owning and controlling the two keys to their business: the audience and revenue streams from it
    -   While it's easy to see how big publishers can get this done, the desires of small players to do this will create an opportunity for someone to help them.

-   Mark Bergen and Jennifer Surane shine a big spotlight on old news in Businessweek:Â [Google buys credit card transaction data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-30/google-and-mastercard-cut-a-secret-ad-deal-to-track-retail-sales)Â to link digital ads with brick-and-mortar purchases.
    -   Maybe it's time for a Pi-Hole?
    -   Or Firefox's new, improvedÂ [anti-tracking protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/08/30/changing-our-approach-to-anti-tracking/)Â to be turned on by default.

-   Sonoma West Publishers, a regional newspaper chain, started aÂ [direct public offering to raise capital](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5abe6871297114ab99a553c5/t/5ac82885352f53a44faca2b7/1523067020521/DPO_package_complete.pdf).
    -   Most interesting is the group's plan for use of the proceeds.
    -   I was surprised to see the plan calls for only $5,000 of spending on "new reader/community live event(s)"
    -   We know how much these can drive revenue, and reach audiences.
    -   I'm writing a piece on how else that money could be spent. Â Know someone at Sonoma West? Â Want to help me brainstorm? Â [Email](mailto:ag@workingpaper.co).

-   Quartz creates aÂ [cryptocurrency newsletter](https://www.wsj.com/articles/quartz-launches-paid-cryptocurrency-newsletter-1535465731)... that is a paid subscription. Â Very on trend.
    -   Multiple revenue streams?Â âœ…
    -   Direct link to the audience?Â âœ…
    -   Focused on an audience that a distinct set of advertisers would like to reach?Â âœ…

## Hacks
-   Apple AirPods are great... and they get disgustingly dirty.
-   Thanks to Working Paper reader Jonathan Friedlander for the tip: Blu Tack gets the detritus out.
-   The newly-clean earbuds sound much better, and have more volume.
-   Getting out the gunk is also remarkably satisfying.Â ðŸ˜‰

## Upgrades
-   [Hitlist](http://www.hitlistapp.com/)Â has been turning up great fares from Chicago.
-   It alerts you when there are well-below-usual fares from your home airport.
