_Programming note: Welcome to the first Working Paper newsletter of 2019!  This year, we’re aiming to deliver about 30 editions... meaning it will become a bi-weekly, with a few special editions when we need to share something faster._

_We write the newsletter to achieve two goals:_
1. _synthesize our thinking on technology and media_
2. _interact with some of the smartest people we know on these topics._

_As such, if you find something interesting in the newsletter, do something about it.  Write back to me, ask questions, forward it to a friend, etc._

_Now, on to the letter._


# Letter
The first time I visited the [Wan Chai Computer Centre](https://www.hongkongtripguide.com/wan-chai-computer-centre.html) in 2009, I was mesmerized.  Not only could I buy every component I needed to build a top-of-the-line PC — and get it today! without ordering online! — but there were also an incredible number of hardware and software _ideas_ on display.  Netbooks were on the ascent, and Microsoft was thinking about how to do touch-based computing (having come to realize the excellence of the iPhone).  I spent hours, parted with very little money, and left with one of the first “convertible” format laptops, along with inexpensive components for a desktop PC.

However, many have wondered if this era of open PCs and the resulting “[generativity](http://futureoftheinternet.org/download)” was long over in an era of App Stores and sealed-in batteries.

For the past few years, I’ve agreed.  I didn’t build any PCs.  I bought iOS devices, and do 90% of my work on an iPad.  I lamented leaving [Sim Lim Square](http://www.simlimsquare.com.sg), Singapore’s equivalent of Wan Chai, empty handed last year because there was nothing I could use.

I changed my thinking late last year, when I figured out what to do with the Raspberry Pi I’d left in my drawer since its 2012 inception: run a [Pi Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) to block all ads and trackers on my network (including _inside_ apps).

The ad-blocking DNS server is still great (for the technical audience: I’ve also switched to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) as my upstream DNS with nice speed improvements), but I’ve started two more projects that have been surprisingly nice: home automation and inexpensive backup.

Today’s tech links deal with the main piece of enabling software, called [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io/).  It’s — shockingly — a bridge between many different connected home devices and Apple’s [HomeKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/home/) protocol.  I’ll write (or link to) more on actually setting it up in a future working paper, but the point to make here is more broad:

We’re back.

With open-source software and [crazily inexpensive open-source hardware](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/DHT-Pro-Shield-for-WeMos-D1-mini-DHT22-Single-bus-digital-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-module/32648082692.html), one can pretty easily tinker with and ***connect*** multiple ***closed*** devices.  I’ve connected my NestCam and my hand-made, $5 WiFi temperature and humidity sensors to Apple’s walled garden of a home automation system.  Each input is on equal footing.  And the result is a delightful system for my apartment.

It’s generativity, but at a different layer of the stack.  I used to mess with the devices; now I mess with the network of devices. (And, if I’m willing — I can dive back into the device-level at any time.)

Will most people build their own home IoT devices? No.  But most people didn't build their own PCs.  Those who did invented new ways of doing things.  That was enough.

Glad to be back, and more in a few days,

Andrew
