_Programming note: Welcome to the first Working Paper newsletter of 2019!  This year, we’re aiming to deliver about 30 editions... meaning it will become a bi-weekly, with a few special editions when we need to share something faster._

_We write the newsletter to achieve two goals:_
1. _synthesize our thinking on technology and media_
2. _interact with some of the smartest people we know on these topics._

_As such, if you find something interesting in the newsletter... do something about it.  Write back to me, ask questions, forward it to a friend, etc._
_Now, on to the letter._

# Letter
The first time I visited the [Wan Chai Computer Centre](wan-chai) in 2009, I was mesmerized.  Not only could I buy every component I needed to build a top-of-the-line PC — and get it today! without ordering online! — but there were also an incredible number of hardware and software _ideas_ on display.  Netbooks were on the ascent, and Microsoft was thinking about how to do touch-based computing (having come to realize the excellence of the iPhone).  I spent hours, parted with very little money, and left with one of the first “convertible” format laptops, along with inexpensive components for a desktop PC.

Generativity

In February of 2012, when the [Raspberry Pi][rpi] was first released, I immediately bought one.  Why?  Because: $35 for a complete Linux PC.  I excitedly connected it to a TV, keyboard and mouse in my grad school office, booted it up, and typed a few commands.  Then I put it in a drawer.

It wasn’t until late last year that I really figured out what to do with one: using [Pi Hole][pi-hole] to block all ads and trackers on your home network (including _inside_ apps).

The ad-blocking DNS server is still great (for the technical audience: I’ve also switched to [Cloudflare][cloudflare-dns] as my upstream DNS with nice speed improvements), but I’ve started two more projects that have been surprisingly nice: home automation and inexpensive backup.

Today’s tech links deal with the main piece of enabling software, called [Homebridge][homebridge].  It’s — shockingly — a bridge between many different connected home devices and Apple’s [HomeKit][homekit] protocol.

This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,** we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options [available in markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add blockquotes, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:

> “Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.”

The theme also supports markdown tables:

| Item                 | Author        | Supports tables? | Price |
|----------------------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Duet Jekyll Theme    | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |
| Index Jekyll Theme   | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |
| Journal Jekyll Theme | Jekyll Themes | Yes              | $39   |

You can throw in some horizontal rules too:

### Image galleries

Here's a really neat custom feature we added – galleries:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we’ve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Pretty cool, huh?

We've packed this theme with powerful features to show off your work.

Why not put them to use on your new portfolio?
