Two pieces caught my attention this week: one sets up the core problem of Facebook in society today. The other sets out a (surprisingly) simple and well-thought-out way to solve it. *I wrote about it on [Working Paper](http://blogs.harvard.edu/workingpaper/2018/08/27/information-fiduciaries/) in more detail, and started a discussion of what it might mean for news organizations, too.*

While the two authors didn't intend to speak to one another directly, they are a part of the same conversation.

[Ian Bogost reviews the history of consumer data brokerage](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/08/the-age-of-privacy-nihilism-is-here/568198/), and how we got to the modern advertising system. He describes the core problem today (accurately, in my view), that:

> "The real difference between the old and the new ages of data-intelligence-driven consumer marketing, and the invasion of privacy they entail, is that lots of people are finally aware that it is taking place."

In a fit of link-clicking on [Lawfare](https://www.lawfareblog.com/) I ended up at a 2016 Atlantic article by [Jack Balkin](https://law.yale.edu/jack-m-balkin) and [Jonathan Zittrain](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/jzittrain), arguing that a simple legal mechanism to regulate tech companies might be the idea of ["information fiduciaries,"](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/10/information-fiduciary/502346/) or companies that are shielded from some liability if they agree to act in our interest.

Historical context for our problem and an elegant update to a historical idea for the solution.

Nice.

Hope you had a great weekend,

Andrew

## Media
-   [Universities are producing investigative journalism, not just teaching it](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2018/08/26/investigative-journalists-keep-robust-free-press/1053443002/).  That's a good thing.
    -   As I've long argued, we should care much more about the outcomes we get from such reportage than we do about the institutions that create it.
    -   Better still, in this case, the journalism program isn't siloed.  ASU is pulling from "accountancy, anthropology, history, law, medicine and many other fields," to teach it's students.
-   In other news, [BuzzFeed is working on a membership program](https://digiday.com/media/buzzfeed-news-quietly-tests-membership-program/) like The Guardian's, in conjunction with the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/).
    -   More revenue sources are better than fewer, but I wonder why news organizations aren't asking tech companies to help in [ways they are better suited](http://blogs.harvard.edu/workingpaper/2018/06/03/tech-for-journalism/).

## Hacks
-   I'm late to the mesh-networking party... But if you have more than one room to cover with fast, consistent WiFi, you need a mesh network.
-   It's the same concept of WiFi repeaters... It just works a LOT better.
-   I'm still playing with my [new router of choice](https://www.amplifi.com/), but so far, I've never had better coverage.

## Upgrades
-   [TripIt](https://tripit.com/) is simply a must. It organizes all your travel info in one place.  It helped me keep all the moving parts straight during the week-long move/drive/ship/family birthday extravaganza.
-   Forward your trip confirmation emails to plans@tripit.com; the service creates an in-app itinerary.
-   You can also share these with family/co-workers/friends.
-   Automatically syncs to your calendar (and does a better job than Gmail's automatic calendar events).
-   Pro tip: because it keeps a history, with TripIt you can also find that [hotel you stayed at in Kyoto 8 years ago](https://hotelkanra.jp/en/) with ease...
